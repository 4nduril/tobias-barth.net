[Last time](/blog/2018/06/Set-up-a-FreeBSD-server-on-DigitalOcean-with-jails-Part-1/) I stopped when my new droplet was initialized. Next, I will do some initial setup work like adding a user, properly configuring SSH access and adding a firewall.

I added my SSH public key to the droplet when I created it, so I can now login by typing:

{% code %}
~ $ ssh -l root <droplet-ip>
{% endcode %}

and then providing my passphrase.

### User setup

First, I will update existing packages. (Sidenote: Since the DO-droplets are not the most heavy-lifting machines, at least in my version, I will install everything as precompiled packages instead of using ports.)

{% code %}

root@pioneer-3:~ #
{% endcode %}

Now I can add my non-privileged user (aptly named "tobi"):

{% code %}
root@pioneer-3:~ # adduser
Username: tobi
Full name: Tobias Barth
Uid (Leave empty for default):
Login group [tobi]:
Login group is tobi. Invite tobi into other groups? []: wheel
Login class [default]:
Shell (sh csh tcsh nologin) [sh]:
Home directory [/home/tobi]:
Home directory permissions (Leave empty for default):
Use password-based authentication? [yes]:
Use an empty password? (yes/no) [no]:
Use a random password? (yes/no) [no]:
Enter password:
Enter password again:
Lock out the account after creation? [no]:
Username   : tobi
Password   : *****
Full Name  : Tobias Barth
Uid        : 1002
Class      :
Groups     : tobi wheel
Home       : /home/tobi
Home Mode  :
Shell      : /bin/sh
Locked     : no
OK? (yes/no): yes
adduser: INFO: Successfully added (tobi) to the user database.
Add another user? (yes/no): no
Goodbye!
{% endcode %}

Notably, I added my new user to the group "wheel" to enable the use of "sudo" for this user. To make that work, I have to edit the file `/usr/local/etc/sudoers`. This is not done directly, but with help from the command `visudo`:

{% code %}
root@pioneer-3:~ # visudo
{% endcode %}

Now, uncomment the line

{% code %}
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
{% endcode %}

### SSH-Configuration

At this point, I can login per SSH as the user "tobi" with my password. That is a step in the right direction (I want to disable root logins), but not ideal. Authentication with public/private key pairs is more secure than using a password. So I will configure that. My public key is already on the server, but within the home directory of root. I can just copy it over to my home folder:

{% code %}
root@pioneer-3:~ # su tobi
[tobi@pioneer-3 ~]$ cd
[tobi@pioneer-3 ~]$ mkdir .ssh
[tobi@pioneer-3 ~]$ chmod 700 .ssh
[tobi@pioneer-3 ~]$ sudo cp /root/authorized_keys .ssh
[tobi@pioneer-3 ~]$ sudo chown tobi:tobi .ssh/authorized_keys
{% endcode %}

I can now login with my SSH-Key and a passphrase as the unprivileged user "tobi". Next, I edit the SSH config in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

I change it so that it contains the following lines and values:

{% code %}
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
{% endcode %}

With this root is excluded from remote and users can only authenticate with a key.

I have sneaked in a different shell prompt and not only that â€“ it's an entire different shell: ZSH. I installed it with `pkg install zsh` and then made it the default shell for both, the root user and the user "tobi". Changing the shell is as easy as:

{% code %}
chsh -s zsh
{% endcode %}

while "being" the user I want to change. Alternatively, I can append the username to the command. Additionally I provided an absolute basic `.zshrc` configuration file for both users:

{% code %}
# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
setopt appendhistory autocd extendedglob nomatch notify
unsetopt beep
# End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
autoload -Uz promptinit compinit
compinit
promptinit
prompt redhat

alias l="ls -al"
{% endcode %}

### Conclusion

This post is already long enough and firewall configuration is a complete new topic. So I will end just here and continue in part 3 of this series.
